# potential_US_wildfire_exposures
This data report presents a modest advancement of NOAAâ€™s HMS work with the aims of spurring additional work on the impacts of wildfire smoke on the health of US Populations. Namely, these should include tracking potential wildfire smoke exposures to identify areas and times most heavily impacted by smoke, adding potential smoke exposures to population characteristics describing the social determinants of health in order to better distribute resources and contextualize public health messages and interventions, and combining information specific to wildfire smoke with other air pollution data to better isolate and understand the contribution of wildfires to poor health.
